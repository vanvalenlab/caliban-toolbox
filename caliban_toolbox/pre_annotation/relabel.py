    Relabels each feature in a 4D npz while preserving relationships.
    Eg, if cell 5 gets relabeled to cell 4, every instance of cell 5 in
    the movie will get relabeled to cell 4 as well.

    Inputs:

        start_val: What label to begin relabeling with. 1 by default but
            could be set to another value if needed for other purposes

    Returns:

    Relabels the first frame of an npz starting from start_val. Each subsequent frame
    gets relabeled based on iou (intersection over union) with the previous frame.
    This can scramble human-annotated 3D label assignments if they exist--
    use relabel_npz_preserve_relationships for relabeling human-corrected 3D labels.
    Useful as a pre-processing step to reduce the human labor that goes into assigning labels.
    This step should be applied when:
        - launching a 3D npz that was created from unrelated 2D predictions
        - the npz has not already been relabeled
        - deep learning predictions are not robust for the data type yet

    Note: the iou-based prediction was implemented for zstack prediction, but should
    work okay for timelapse movies as well (although it is not expected to get divisions).
    Deep learning tracking should be used to predict timelapse movies if the segmentations
    are sufficiently good, otherwise this is an acceptable first pass.
