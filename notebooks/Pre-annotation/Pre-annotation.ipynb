To help us do this, we\\'re asking you to help create annotated datasets where single cells are manually identified. We can then feed this into the computer program to teach it how to accurately identify cells by itself. The program developed using the data you are annotating will be used in other research laboratories to study a range of topics, including viruses and cancer cells. <u>The software we create is only as good as the data used to create it, so accuracy in your annotations is extremely important.&nbsp;</u></p>\\n<p>In this job, each image consists of a sequence of snapshots in time, ordered from left to right, top to bottom. Every image in this sequence needs to be annotated. An example of what the image should look like before and after your annotation is shown below:</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdflower-make-cloud/images%2F1533207319808-pic5.png\" style=\"width: 663px; height: 383.06665542602536px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" /></p>\\n<p><br /></p>\\n<p><strong><u>Annotation Instructions:</u></strong></p>\\n<p>You must stick to the following rules when labelling cells (further explanations are provided below):</p>\\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdflower-make-cloud/images%2F1533063612054-Screen+Shot+2018-07-31+at+11.59.45.png\" style=\"width: 731px; height: 441.0253411787975px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" /></p>\\n<p>One good strategy to use would be to start from a specific region and follow one cell at a time across all the frames. &nbsp;After the first cell is colored the same across all the frames it is present in, go back and choose a neighboring one. &nbsp;Continue doing this to build up to the entire frame, one cell at a time (<u><span style=\"color: rgb(209, 72, 65);\"><strong>never</strong></span> reuse colors for different cells, even if the cell disappears before the end of the frames)</u>.</p>\\n<p><br /><strong><u>Annotation Technique</u></strong></p>\\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Zoom in on a frame and use the brush tool to outline the cell and fill in the middle, changing the brush size using the slider.
